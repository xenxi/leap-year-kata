# Leap Year Kata ðŸŽŠ

## User Story:

As a user, I want to know if a year is a leap year, So that I can plan for an extra day on February 29th during those years.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. All years **divisible by 400** ARE **leap years** (so, for example, 2000 was indeed a leap year),
2. All years **divisible by 100 but not by 400** are **NOT leap years** (so, for example, 1700, 1800, and 1900 were  NOT leap years, NOR will 2100 be a leap year),
3. All years **divisible by 4 but not by 100** ARE **leap years** (e.g., 2008, 2012, 2016),
4. All years **not divisible by 4** are **NOT leap years** (e.g. 2017, 2018, 2019).
